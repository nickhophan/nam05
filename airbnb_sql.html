								<h3>Issues & Solutions</h3>
								<h4>Issues</h4>
								<p>-The far the distance was from center, The less the number of bookings<br />

									-The distribution of accomodations is not normal in Berlin, even the transportation system is very common.<br />
									
									-The distribution of bookings was unstable in every month<br />
									
									-There were low bookings in some months of the summer (July, September & October) when was the busiest season of visitors in Berlin<br />
									
									-This caused more loss for the hosts and business throughout the year, the forecasting on guests will be significantly complicated and requires more dimensions inputs.<br />
									
									-The decrease of bookings in Spring led to low revenue (below 28,314,381)<br />
									
									-Places in Mitte had high availability in January (above 40,000 places)<br />
									
									-Less international guests would probably had huge impact on the business's revenue. The lack of rental guests in January in Mitte was an example. The huge loss in Mitte would affect the long-term business operation.<br />
									
									-The number of available rooms was still large compared to the capacity<br />
									
									-Airbnb was still not able to fill the availability effectively, there was still many available rooms left over the season without any promoting plans.<br />
									
									-Hosts in popular places prefer the lease contract<br />
									
									-The number of bookings for lease in Kreuzberg, Mitte, Neukollin and Pankow. Thus, these places might be suitable for who travel for work or long trip.<br />
									
									-Strict policy limited the bookings, the strict policy in low season could cause more loss. For example, the strict 14 days almost had high rate of availability in the whole season.<br />
									
									-The conservative policy in some places can potentially affect the interest of customers in long term.</p>
								<h4>Solutions</h4>
								-Airbnb should promote more the accomocations in low areas to increase the interest of customers, instead of just focusing on the popular areas which affect the diversity of platform. In another side. Customers will tend to change into local platforms to look for unique places out of the center.<br />

								-The accurate forecasting of customers in and out during a month will help business keep track of the coming bookings to manage the availability, limit the sudden fall of bookings and quickly have plan for promotion.<br />
								
								-The business should keep track with the amount of international guests every year to attract more potential customers, and has good strategy to make policy more appropriate for with partners to support their business operation.<br />
								
								-The available rooms should be promoted with more special price and events to maximize the revenue every month.<br />
								
								-Ensure the potential customers for lease place because it will maintain the profit efficiently.<br />
								
								-Being flexible on low months, minimize the risk of available rooms, especially when it is located in less popular places.<br />
